# Department REST API

## Overview

The Department REST API is designed to manage organizational departments efficiently. It provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting department records. Whether you're building an HR system, an inventory management tool, or any other application that deals with organizational structure, this API will be a valuable asset.

## Features

1. **Create Department:**
   - Use the `POST /departments` endpoint to add a new department.
   - Provide details such as department name, description, and any other relevant attributes.

2. **Retrieve Department:**
   - Fetch department details using the `GET /departments/{id}` endpoint.
   - Retrieve information about a specific department by its unique identifier.

3. **Update Department:**
   - Modify department details using the `PUT /departments/{id}` endpoint.
   - Update attributes like department head, budget, or location.

4. **Delete Department:**
   - Remove a department using the `DELETE /departments/{id}` endpoint.
   - Ensure proper authorization and handle cascading effects (e.g., reassign employees).

## Technical Details

- **Technology Stack:**
  - Built with Spring Boot, a popular Java framework for creating RESTful APIs.
  - Utilizes JPA (Java Persistence API) for database interaction.
  - Employs Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation.

- **Database Schema:**
  - The department entity typically includes fields like:
    - `id`: Unique identifier for the department.
    - `name`: Name of the department (e.g., "Engineering," "Marketing").
    - `description`: Brief description of the department's responsibilities.
    - Additional fields based on your specific requirements.

- **Authentication and Authorization:**
  - Implement proper authentication (OAuth, JWT, etc.) to secure endpoints.
  - Define authorization rules (e.g., only department heads can update department details).

## Real-World Use Cases

1. **HR Management System:**
   - HR teams can use this API to manage departments, track headcounts, and assign employees.
   - Automate processes like onboarding, transfers, and promotions.

2. **Financial Systems:**
   - Finance departments can analyze budget allocation across different departments.
   - Generate reports on spending trends and cost centers.

3. **Project Management Tools:**
   - Project managers can associate teams with specific departments.
   - Monitor project progress by department.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Configure your database settings in `application.properties`.
